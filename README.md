Topic: Breakout Strategy.

## Overview
* In this project, you will code and evaluate a breakout trading signal. You'll find and remove any outliers. You'll test to see if it has the potential to be profitable using a Histogram and P-Value. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.
