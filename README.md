For Udacity's [AI for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880) Nanodegree.

Topic: Advanced Quantitative Trading.

## Overview
* Creating and backtesting a breakout trading signal. Outliers are removed in order to ensure a robust backtesting process.
* The dataset is a set of end-of-day stock prices that comes from Quotemedia.

## Concepts
* Identifying long and short breakout trading signals over various time windows.
* Filtering out repeated long/short signals inside each time window.
* Using the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test to identify outliers.
* Computing signal return only after removing all outliers that were discovered.
